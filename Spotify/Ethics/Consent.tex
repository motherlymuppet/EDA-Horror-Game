	\section{Experiment}
	
	You are invited to participate in a research study exploring how to design an AI system to search for relaxing songs. The aim of this experiment is to help determine whether short clips of music have the same effect on the body's stress response as whole songs. During the session, you will wear a sensor on your fingers to measure your body's stress response. You will play a short (1 minute) computer game to calibrate the sensor. You will then listen to a series of clips from songs. The researcher may ask questions about how a song makes you feel.
	
	\section{Risks}
	
	There are no direct risks to you by participating in this study. Since the songs are being selected randomly, a distressing song may be selected. If specific songs are known trauma triggers for you, alert the researcher now and those songs can be blacklisted to prevent them being chosen. You are free to refuse to answer any questions or ask to skip songs that are distressing. This will not impact your participation in the study.
	
	\section{Time Cost}
	
	Your total time involved will be approximately 30 minutes, with around 25 minutes of that time spent listening to music. This time is flexible based on your availability and you may stop at any point or stay for longer. You are under no obligation to participate in anything after this session.
	
	\section{Confidentiality}
	
	You will not be personally identifiable as having participated in this research. Any personally identifiable information will be deleted after the project's completion. Any information released will be linked solely to your Candidate ID and not your name. No individual raw data from the session will be released, unless you sign the Voluntary Release of Data. Sensor readings (including song metadata) in aggregate (averages, sums, and trends across all participants), will be published in the finished paper but will not be included in a data dump.

	\section{Contacts}
	
	To receive the results of this project once it is complete, you may sign up to the mailing list at \url{http://eepurl.com/dKBEHc}. Participants must sign the \emph{Voluntary Release of Data} and remember their unique participant ID if they wish to identify their results. The expected completion date is June 2019.\\
