most people felt there were too many jump scares. This is also apparent when looking at the frequency curve for scares - the algorithm in most cases decreased the rate of scares. The control group felt marginally more overwhelmed than the intervention group, suggesting that the control group was more aware of how frequent the scares were, perhaps as a result of their lower effectiveness.
