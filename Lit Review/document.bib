	title = {Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions},
	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the ﬁeld of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to ﬁt response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efﬁcient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

	abstract = {Music could change our emotions, could have an influence on our mood, and finally could affect our health. Music therapy is one of the oldest methods used for treating some diseases. Since music therapy is proved to be the helpful approach, we proposed to combine music therapy process with the real-time {EEG}-based human emotion recognition algorithm. By this, we could identify the user’s current emotional state, and based on such neurofeedback we could adjust the music therapy to the patient’s needs. The proposed emotion recognition algorithm could recognize in real-time six emotions such as fear, frustrated, sad, happy, pleasant, and satisfied. As the algorithm is based on an Arousal-Valence emotion model, it has a potential to recognize all emotions that could be defined by the 2-dimensional model. The experiments on emotion induction with sound stimuli from International Affective Digitized Sounds ({IADS}) database and with music stimuli and implemented questionnaire were proposed and realized. In this paper, we proposed a general {EEG}-enabled music therapy algorithm. It allows us to adapt the therapy to the predefined time of the treatment and adjust the music therapy session to the current emotional state of the user in a way as an experienced music therapist works.},

	abstract = {Music listening has been suggested to beneficially impact health via stress-reducing effects. However, the existing literature presents itself with a limited number of investigations and with discrepancies in reported findings that may result from methodological shortcomings (e.g. small sample size, no valid stressor). It was the aim of the current study to address this gap in knowledge and overcome previous shortcomings by thoroughly examining music effects across endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response.

Sixty healthy female volunteers (mean age = 25 years) were exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test after having been randomly assigned to one of three different conditions prior to the stress test: 1) relaxing music (‘Miserere’, Allegri) ({RM}), 2) sound of rippling water ({SW}), and 3) rest without acoustic stimulation (R). Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase ({sAA}), heart rate ({HR}), respiratory sinus arrhythmia ({RSA}), subjective stress perception and anxiety were repeatedly assessed in all subjects. We hypothesized that listening to {RM} prior to the stress test, compared to {SW} or R would result in a decreased stress response across all measured parameters.

The three conditions significantly differed regarding cortisol response (p = 0.025) to the stressor, with highest concentrations in the {RM} and lowest in the {SW} condition. After the stressor, {sAA} (p=0.026) baseline values were reached considerably faster in the {RM} group than in the R group. {HR} and psychological measures did not significantly differ between groups. 

Our findings indicate that music listening impacted the psychobiological stress system. Listening to music prior to a standardized stressor predominantly affected the autonomic nervous system (in terms of a faster recovery), and to a lesser degree the endocrine and psychological stress response. These findings may help better understanding the beneficial effects of music on the human body.},

Results revealed statistically significant positive relationships between enjoyment of evoked negative emotion in response to music with both absorption and the recently reported construct of 'music empathy,' Factor analysis and a regression model confirmed these results, and the approach suggests that further study of individual differences will continue to provide new insights into some of the subtleties of the enjoyment of negative emotions in music.},

Skin conductance level ({SCL}) data showed that fast-paced music elicits greater activation than slow-paced music. Genre significantly interacted with tempo in {SCR} frequency, with faster tempo increasing activation for classical music while decreasing it for rock music. A second experiment was conducted to explore the possibility that the presumed familiarity of the genre led to this interaction.

	abstract = {In this work, an algorithm for the optimization of costly constrained systems is introduced. The proposed method combines advantages of global- and local-search algorithms with new concepts of feasibility space mapping, within a framework that aims to find global solutions with minimum sampling. A global search is initially performed, during which kriging surrogate models of the objective and the feasible region are developed. A novel search criterion for locating feasibility boundaries is introduced, which does not require any assumptions regarding the convexity and nonlinearity of the feasible space. Finally, local search is performed starting from multiple locations identified by clustering of previously obtained samples. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through both benchmark examples and a case study from the pharmaceutical industry. A comparison of the method with commercially available software reveals that the proposed method has a competitive performance in terms of sampling requirements and quality of solution. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 60: 2462–2474, 2014},
