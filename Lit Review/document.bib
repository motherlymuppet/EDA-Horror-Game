	title = {Efficient {Global} {Optimization} of {Expensive} {Black}-{Box} {Functions}},
	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the ﬁeld of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to ﬁt response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efﬁcient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

	abstract = {Music could change our emotions, could have an influence on our mood, and finally could affect our health. Music therapy is one of the oldest methods used for treating some diseases. Since music therapy is proved to be the helpful approach, we proposed to combine music therapy process with the real-time EEG-based human emotion recognition algorithm. By this, we could identify the user’s current emotional state, and based on such neurofeedback we could adjust the music therapy to the patient’s needs. The proposed emotion recognition algorithm could recognize in real-time six emotions such as fear, frustrated, sad, happy, pleasant, and satisfied. As the algorithm is based on an Arousal-Valence emotion model, it has a potential to recognize all emotions that could be defined by the 2-dimensional model. The experiments on emotion induction with sound stimuli from International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) database and with music stimuli and implemented questionnaire were proposed and realized. In this paper, we proposed a general EEG-enabled music therapy algorithm. It allows us to adapt the therapy to the predefined time of the treatment and adjust the music therapy session to the current emotional state of the user in a way as an experienced music therapist works.},

	abstract = {Music listening has been suggested to beneficially impact health via stress-reducing effects. However, the existing literature presents itself with a limited number of investigations and with discrepancies in reported findings that may result from methodological shortcomings (e.g. small sample size, no valid stressor). It was the aim of the current study to address this gap in knowledge and overcome previous shortcomings by thoroughly examining music effects across endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response.

Sixty healthy female volunteers (mean age = 25 years) were exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test after having been randomly assigned to one of three different conditions prior to the stress test: 1) relaxing music (‘Miserere’, Allegri) (RM), 2) sound of rippling water (SW), and 3) rest without acoustic stimulation (R). Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), subjective stress perception and anxiety were repeatedly assessed in all subjects. We hypothesized that listening to RM prior to the stress test, compared to SW or R would result in a decreased stress response across all measured parameters.

The three conditions significantly differed regarding cortisol response (p = 0.025) to the stressor, with highest concentrations in the RM and lowest in the SW condition. After the stressor, sAA (p=0.026) baseline values were reached considerably faster in the RM group than in the R group. HR and psychological measures did not significantly differ between groups. 

Our findings indicate that music listening impacted the psychobiological stress system. Listening to music prior to a standardized stressor predominantly affected the autonomic nervous system (in terms of a faster recovery), and to a lesser degree the endocrine and psychological stress response. These findings may help better understanding the beneficial effects of music on the human body.},

Fifty-nine participants completed a survey pertaining to this question. Results revealed statistically significant positive relationships between enjoyment of evoked negative emotion in response to music with both absorption and the recently reported construct of 'music empathy,' Factor analysis and a regression model confirmed these results, and the approach suggests that further study of individual differences will continue to provide new insights into some of the subtleties of the enjoyment of negative emotions in music.},

Skin conductance level (SCL) data showed that fast-paced music elicits greater activation than slow-paced music. Genre significantly interacted with tempo in SCR frequency, with faster tempo increasing activation for classical music while decreasing it for rock music. A second experiment was conducted to explore the possibility that the presumed familiarity of the genre led to this interaction.

	abstract = {In this work, an algorithm for the optimization of costly constrained systems is introduced. The proposed method combines advantages of global- and local-search algorithms with new concepts of feasibility space mapping, within a framework that aims to find global solutions with minimum sampling. A global search is initially performed, during which kriging surrogate models of the objective and the feasible region are developed. A novel search criterion for locating feasibility boundaries is introduced, which does not require any assumptions regarding the convexity and nonlinearity of the feasible space. Finally, local search is performed starting from multiple locations identified by clustering of previously obtained samples. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through both benchmark examples and a case study from the pharmaceutical industry. A comparison of the method with commercially available software reveals that the proposed method has a competitive performance in terms of sampling requirements and quality of solution. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 60: 2462–2474, 2014},

	abstract = {Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the “default” mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.},

	abstract = {E cient Global Optimization (EGO) is an e ective method to optimize expensive black-box functions and utilizes Kriging models (or Gaussian process regression) trained on a relatively small design data set. In real-world applications, such as experimental optimization, where a large data set is available, the EGO algorithm becomes computationally infeasible due to the time and space complexity of Kriging. Recently, the so-called Cluster Kriging methods have been proposed to reduce such complexities for the big data, where data sets are clustered and Kriging models are built on each cluster. Furthermore, Kriging models are combined in an optimal way for the prediction. In addition, we analyze the Cluster Kriging landscape to adopt the existing in ll-criteria, e.g., the expected improvement. e approach is tested on selected global optimization problems. It is shown by the empirical studies that this approach signi cantly reduces the CPU time of the EGO algorithm while maintaining the convergence rate of the algorithm.},
