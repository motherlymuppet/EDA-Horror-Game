	abstract = {Researchers have been inspired by nature in many different ways. A new population based search method called the Bee Algorithm ({BA}) is proposed. The swarm based algorithm described in this paper goes beyond the traditional design and revolves around mimicking the food foraging behaviour of honey bees which has been applied to solve unconstrained functions in the domain of continuous space. The authors believe this algorithm is very efficient and robust, as indicated by the extensive simulation results on numerous benchmarking problems.},

By proposing several algorithmic variants and simple convergence analyses, we make two main contributions. First, we provide a uniﬁed viewpoint for several ﬁrst-order optimization techniques such as accelerated proximal gradient, block coordinate descent, or {FrankWolfe} algorithms. Second, we introduce a new incremental scheme that experimentally matches or outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale optimization problems typically arising in machine learning.},

	title = {Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the ﬁeld of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to ﬁt response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efﬁcient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.},

In real-world applications, such as experimental optimization, where a large data set is available, the {EGO} algorithm becomes computationally infeasible due to the time and space complexity of Kriging. Recently, the so-called Cluster Kriging methods have been proposed to reduce such complexities for the big data, where data sets are clustered and Kriging models are built on each cluster. Furthermore, Kriging models are combined in an optimal way for the prediction. In addition, we analyze the Cluster Kriging landscape to adopt the existing in ll-criteria, e.g., the expected improvement. e approach is tested on selected global optimization problems. It is shown by the empirical studies that this approach signi cantly reduces the {CPU} time of the {EGO} algorithm while maintaining the convergence rate of the algorithm.},

Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the “default” mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.},

	abstract = {In this work, an algorithm for the optimization of costly constrained systems is introduced. The proposed method combines advantages of global- and local-search algorithms with new concepts of feasibility space mapping, within a framework that aims to find global solutions with minimum sampling. A global search is initially performed, during which kriging surrogate models of the objective and the feasible region are developed. A novel search criterion for locating feasibility boundaries is introduced, which does not require any assumptions regarding the convexity and nonlinearity of the feasible space. Finally, local search is performed starting from multiple locations identified by clustering of previously obtained samples. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through both benchmark examples and a case study from the pharmaceutical industry. A comparison of the method with commercially available software reveals that the proposed method has a competitive performance in terms of sampling requirements and quality of solution. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 60: 2462–2474, 2014},

	abstract = {Music could change our emotions, could have an influence on our mood, and finally could affect our health. Music therapy is one of the oldest methods used for treating some diseases. Since music therapy is proved to be the helpful approach, we proposed to combine music therapy process with the real-time {EEG}-based human emotion recognition algorithm. By this, we could identify the user’s current emotional state, and based on such neurofeedback we could adjust the music therapy to the patient’s needs. The proposed emotion recognition algorithm could recognize in real-time six emotions such as fear, frustrated, sad, happy, pleasant, and satisfied. As the algorithm is based on an Arousal-Valence emotion model, it has a potential to recognize all emotions that could be defined by the 2-dimensional model. The experiments on emotion induction with sound stimuli from International Affective Digitized Sounds ({IADS}) database and with music stimuli and implemented questionnaire were proposed and realized. In this paper, we proposed a general {EEG}-enabled music therapy algorithm. It allows us to adapt the therapy to the predefined time of the treatment and adjust the music therapy session to the current emotional state of the user in a way as an experienced music therapist works.},

	abstract = {Music listening has been suggested to beneficially impact health via stress-reducing effects. However, the existing literature presents itself with a limited number of investigations and with discrepancies in reported findings that may result from methodological shortcomings (e.g. small sample size, no valid stressor). It was the aim of the current study to address this gap in knowledge and overcome previous shortcomings by thoroughly examining music effects across endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response.

Sixty healthy female volunteers (mean age = 25 years) were exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test after having been randomly assigned to one of three different conditions prior to the stress test: 1) relaxing music (‘Miserere’, Allegri) ({RM}), 2) sound of rippling water ({SW}), and 3) rest without acoustic stimulation (R). Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase ({sAA}), heart rate ({HR}), respiratory sinus arrhythmia ({RSA}), subjective stress perception and anxiety were repeatedly assessed in all subjects. We hypothesized that listening to {RM} prior to the stress test, compared to {SW} or R would result in a decreased stress response across all measured parameters.

The three conditions significantly differed regarding cortisol response (p = 0.025) to the stressor, with highest concentrations in the {RM} and lowest in the {SW} condition. After the stressor, {sAA} (p=0.026) baseline values were reached considerably faster in the {RM} group than in the R group. {HR} and psychological measures did not significantly differ between groups. 

Our findings indicate that music listening impacted the psychobiological stress system. Listening to music prior to a standardized stressor predominantly affected the autonomic nervous system (in terms of a faster recovery), and to a lesser degree the endocrine and psychological stress response. These findings may help better understanding the beneficial effects of music on the human body.},

Fifty-nine participants completed a survey pertaining to this question. Results revealed statistically significant positive relationships between enjoyment of evoked negative emotion in response to music with both absorption and the recently reported construct of 'music empathy,' Factor analysis and a regression model confirmed these results, and the approach suggests that further study of individual differences will continue to provide new insights into some of the subtleties of the enjoyment of negative emotions in music.},

Skin conductance level ({SCL}) data showed that fast-paced music elicits greater activation than slow-paced music. Genre significantly interacted with tempo in {SCR} frequency, with faster tempo increasing activation for classical music while decreasing it for rock music. A second experiment was conducted to explore the possibility that the presumed familiarity of the genre led to this interaction. Although further evidence was found for conceptualizing musical beat onsets as auditory structure, the familiarity explanation was not supported.},

	abstract = {A consistent theme across general theories of emotion is that intense emotions are accompanied by increased levels of physiological arousal. The aim in the current study was to determine whether music which elicited intense emotions produced higher levels of physiological arousal than less emotionally powerful music. Twenty-one participants (9 females, 12 males) were exposed to relaxing music, arousing (but not emotionally powerful) music, an emotionally powerful film scene, and a music piece selected by participants as ‘emotionally powerful’. A range of physiological and subjective measures of arousal was recorded before and during the treatments. The emotionally powerful music treatment elicited significantly greater increases in skin conductance and number of chills than the other treatments. The findings are discussed in terms of the sensitivity of skin conductance and chills as measures of emotional intensity, and it is suggested the study offers some support for the emotivist thesis of musical emotions.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a general method for improving the structure and quality of sequences generated by a recurrent neural network ({RNN}), while maintaining information originally learned from data, as well as sample diversity. An {RNN} is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation ({MLE}), and the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior policy. Another {RNN} is then trained using reinforcement learning ({RL}) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the {MLE} {RNN}. To formalize this objective, we derive novel off-policy {RL} methods for {RNNs} from {KL}-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2) computational molecular generation. For both problems, we show that the proposed method improves the desired properties and structure of the generated sequences, while maintaining information learned from data.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach for the generation of polyphonic music based on {LSTMs}. We generate music in two steps. First, a chord {LSTM} predicts a chord progression based on a chord embedding. A second {LSTM} then generates polyphonic music from the predicted chord progression. The generated music sounds pleasing and harmonic, with only few dissonant notes. It has clear long-term structure that is similar to what a musician would play during a jam session. We show that our approach is sensible from a music theory perspective by evaluating the learned chord embeddings. Surprisingly, our simple model managed to extract the circle of fifths, an important tool in music theory, from the dataset.},
