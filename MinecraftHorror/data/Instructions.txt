Instructions for participant:

You will be placed in a haunted house environment.
Your job is to find all 16 coloured wool in the house.
The wool is placed inside chests, 1 per chest.
Not all chests contain wool.
Don't worry if you can't find all the wool in 10 minutes, it is intentionally hard.
If you do manage to find all of the wool, continue to explore the house until you are told to stop.

At various points during the test a jump-scare will occur. They have no impact on the gameplay.
You will be wearing a sensor on your fingers which measures your response to these jump-scares.
You will also be wearing headphones to listen to the game sound. Spooky music will be playing.

Your playtest will last 10 minutes, after which a message will appear on the screen informing you that the test is complete.

The controls for the game are as follows:
W           = move forwards
A           = move left
S           = move backwards
D           = move right
Space       = jump
Left-click  = used to move wool into your inventory
Right-click = open/close doors and chests

Talk to the researcher if you have any issues or concerns.
